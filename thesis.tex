%\usepackage{glossaries}      % see http:}/en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
%\usepackage{asymptote}       % for graphics
% The asymptote package allows for very nice graphics and figures
% Proper usage requires additional information located at:

% See the gallery at this URL for examples

%\usepackage{placeins}        % float placement
% Provides \FloatBarrier which keeps figures/tables in the same section.
% LaTeX sometimes moves them to fill up pages.

\NPSexecsummary{ 
The field of adaptive control offers techniques for increasing performance and robustness in numerous settings and applications.  Adaptive control is different than traditional feedback in that it offers a mechanism for adjusting the controller's parameters to reduce plant uncertainty.  Traditional feedback control utilizes parameters, which are specified by the engineer to optimize an ideal use case, which often times requires extensive tuning and testing.  Adaptive controllers adjust their control parameters using various intelligent mechanisms designed to   increase robustness to plant variation or unanticipated disturbances.  Adaptive control has many applications in the aerospace domain to include control strategies when aerodynamic coefficients are unknown or are non-constant, actuator failure, airframe damage, etc.   This research evaluates fixed wing \ac{UAS} controller performance and robustness using the \Lone adaptive control architecture.

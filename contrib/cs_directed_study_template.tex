% Directed Study Request Form Template
%
% This is a Latex template for the Directed Study Request Form.  It is 
% based on the paper copy provided by the CS department, last acquired
% June 2012.
%
% This should be built using the Makefile in the domex-report directory
% and adding directedstudy-template.pdf (or the saved title) to the 
% ALL variable.

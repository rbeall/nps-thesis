% This is a Latex template for the GSOIS thesis proposal.  It is modeled
% off of the Word template provided at 
% http://www.nps.edu/Academics/Schools/GSOIS/Departments/CS/ProgOfficer/CSProgOfficer.html
%
% This should be built using the Makefile in the domex-report directory
% and adding thesisproposal-template.pdf (or the saved title) to the

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% B. Area of Research
%
% Identify the proposed area of research in brief terms and state the 
% proposed title of the thesis.  The exact title can be changed as the 
% research and writing progress. A more detailed discussion is required 
% in D below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Area of Research}

The proposed topic of the thesis is [GENERAL AREA OF RESEARCH].  

The title of this thesis will be \textbf{[THESIS TITLE]}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% C. Research Questions
%
% Identify the primary research question and subsidiary research
% questions. The primary research question should be broad enough
% that it covers the entire spectrum of the research activity.  
% Subsidiary research questions subdivide the primary research question 
% into manageable research segments. This should be a very explicit 
% statement of the questions the research will seek to answer.  While 
% the questions may be redefined later as the research progresses, the 
% initial objectives should be made very specific.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Research Questions}

Research questions being pursued in this work include:

\begin{itemize}

\item This is the first research question.

\item This is the second research question and a citation \cite{mm2}.

\item This is the first research question.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% D. Discussion
%
% Discuss briefly the background leading up to this study, the major 
% issues and concepts involved, the key problems related to this area, 
% policy and operational considerations and implications, and the 
% theoretical framework within which the study will be conducted.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}

[DISCUSSION]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% E. Scope of Thesis
%
% Describe the main thrust of the study, what areas will be specifically
% investigated and what areas will be excluded.  Put boundaries around 
% the study.  Identify what the study will be (e.g., a case study, 
% implementation guide, development of a model, assessment of a model, 
% policy or management guide).  Discuss any limitations of the study.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Scope of the Thesis}

[SCOPE]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% F. Methodology
%
% This section should explain the conceptual foundation or framework 
% within which the questions will be examined and the specific research 
% techniques that will be used to answer the questions.  In other words, 
% the study should be conducted within the context of some recognized and
% valid model of problem solving and should use appropriate methods of 
% collecting and analyzing data relevant to the problem.  For example, if 
% the problem were to determine the optimal replacement cycle for lights
% on navigational buoys, the conceptual foundation (model) might be the 
% present value of life cycle cost.  The research method might then 
% include collection of actual data on the amounts of all relevant costs, 
% statistical analysis to determine the expected value of such costs, and 
% discounting to determine the lowest present value of all alternative 
% life cycle cost patterns.  Describe the general kinds of information to 
% be used, the sources from which the data will be collected, and the 
% methodology to be used in collecting the data.  Be specific in 
% identifying the method(s) of research (e.g., questionnaires, interviews, 
% etc.) why the method(s) selected are appropriate, and what types of 
% individuals/organizations will be approached.  Discuss how any 
% limitations identified in Part E above will affect your methodology or 
% data sources. Briefly list the kinds of questions you intend to include 
% in your questionnaire or you expect to use during interviews.

% of chapter content.

% H. Schedule
%
% This is a tentative list of target dates for completion of the 
% successive states of the project.  You will not be held strictly to 
% this schedule; it is a means of conveying to others when you expect to 
% complete major milestones of the study.  It is important to recognize 
% that the various stages of the work must be done in a logical sequence 
% and that these various stages require different amounts of time.  
% (Note that this section of the proposal fulfills the requirements that
% a schedule be attached to Thesis Report No. 1.)  Give the dates during 
% which the various stages will be accomplished.  Your stages may differ 
% from the sample below.
%
%  1. Literature review:    
%  2. Draft thesis, Cover through Chapter 2, and initial list of references 
% <to advisor(s) to check background knowledge and problem statement, and 
% to approve proposed plan to conduct research>   
%  3. Draft thesis checked by thesis processor for format:    
%  4. Construct research design:    
%  5. Conduct research and any associated travel:    
%  6. Analyze data:    
%  7. Draft thesis to advisor(s):    
%  8. Final thesis submission for signatures:     
%
% The list of activities/milestones above may be modified as required; 
% however, enough fidelity must exist to give the reviewers a good idea 
% of how you plan to complete your thesis.

% J. Anticipated Travel/Funding Requirements
%
% List the locations to which you must travel to conduct your research, 
% anticipated length of stay and approximate amount required for travel, 
% per diem and miscellaneous expenses.  Be realistic in identifying your 
% needs and do so as early as possible.  Your advisor and Curricular 
% Officer can assist in finding sources of funds.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Anticipated Travel/Funding Requirements}
There is currently no anticipated travel.
% If you anticipate traveling for conferences or meetings for your thesis, 
% fill out the appropriate information in the table below and uncomment the 
% related lines.  This section should be consistent with what was previously 
% reported on the signature page.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% K. Preliminary Bibliography
%
% Provide a listing of representative materials consulted during 
% preliminary literature search.  This should include references to the 
% problem or issue to be studied, the organizations or other context in 
% which it arises, and the research method(s) to be used.  It should 
% include any prior studies of a similar nature.  A minimum of three 
% references is required.  A Thesis/Dissertation can be one of the three; 
% the other two must then be non-thesis/non-dissertation references.  The 
% final bibliography will probably be much more extensive.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Preliminary Bibliography}
% This is a hack to reduce the space between the section header and the 
% reference list.  Since the reference list has a blank title, it results 
% in extra space between the reference contents and the section header.
% parskip value of 0 was tested but still left a large gap. 
% You should comment this out if it is causing problems
\setlength{\parskip}{-.15in} 

% print the bibliography with no title
\renewcommand{\refname}{} % redefines the reference title to blank

% list all references that should be included but weren't cited
\nocite{mm2} % don't technically need because we cited mm2, but just for demo
%\nocite{[CITATION 1]}
%\nocite{[CITATION 2]}
%\nocite{[CITATION 3]}

\bibliographystyle{plain}
% include the .bib file where your references come from, only list the file 
% root (e.g. thesis for thesis.bib)

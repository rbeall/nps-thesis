The aircraft used for this research was the Flitetest Spear \cite{flitetest}.  The Spear airframe was chosen for its endurance capability of greater than 45 minutes of flight time and it's large capacity fuselage.  The flying-wing architecture keeps the actuation requirement to a minimum of two servos by utilizing an elevon configuration.

The large blunt nose provides adequate space for two 2,200 mAh (12.6volts) lithium polymer batteries wired in parallel.  The remaining cargo space was used for accommodating the Pixhawk autopilot.

This plane was constructed out of craft foam board.  The plans were downloaded from flitetest.com\cite{flitetest} and converted to CorelDraw vector files for use in a laser cutter.  These files were then cut out of four sheets of foam board using the laser cutter.  The wing halves were joined with standard box tape and hot-glue.  This provided a cheap and rapid construction process which was achievable under four hours of build time.

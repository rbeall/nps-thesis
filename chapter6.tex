\section{\Lone Adaptive Control Algorithm Tuning}
The primary goal of this research was to reduce the complexity of tuning expertise required to get an unknown airframe airborne successfully.  The amount of time required to get the adequate airframe performance using the \Lone algorithm is significantly reduced.  Three primary features need tuning: the adaptation gain, the controller filter, and the companion model.

\subsection{Tuning the Adaptation gain}
Tuning the adaptation gain is fairly intuitive.  The adaptation gain is a function of the loop frequency at which the filter is run so it may only need to be tuned for a given autopilot at a given loop rate and not for every specific aircraft.  Anecdotally, the adaptation gain of 10,000 was used on the Pixhawk1 autopilot running the scheduled loop rate at 100Hz across multiple aircraft without needing to modify.  The primary feedback to the user for tuning this gain resides in the desired movement of the estimated states.  The adaptation gain was set low (1-10) while watching the parameters $(\theta, \omega, \sigma)$ adapt.  The adaptation gain is slowly increased until the desired rate of adaptation as seen in the real time monitoring of the parameters is adequate.  Another approach for tuning the adaptation rate is to increase the gain until parameters start to oscillate between the bounds and then reduce it.  This bang-bang response in the parameter adaptation will show up in the performance of the controller as increased peaks away from zero error between desired and achieved.  In the case of this research, this noise can be hard to identify in the rate control itself and therefore is why monitoring the attitude error helps find the appropriate adaptation gain which is extremely high but still not injecting attitude error spikes.

\subsection{Tuning the Controller Filter}
The adaptation feedback gain $(k)$, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:l1_filter} was by far the most influential gain to tune.  The simplicity of tuning the \Lone algorithm resides in the fact that the majority of lay users could adequately tune an airframe with this stand-alone gain.  Adequate values for this gain ranged from 0.3 for responsive aircraft and 2.0 for very sluggish aircraft.  This value was set for both the roll and pitch axis independently.  As seen in equation~\ref{eq:l1_filter}, this value is establishing the cutoff frequency of the control filter that separates the bandwidth limited control channel output and the high bandwidth adaptation.  The default value assigned in the source code was 0.45, which proved to be a good starting point.  If the default value for $k$ is not correct, then the control channel will produce either low-frequency oscillations or high-frequency oscillations.  The low-frequency oscillations are produced because the bandwidth of the control is too low and there should be a perceptible lag between the desired state and the achieved state.  High-frequency oscillations occur when the control filter bandwidth is set higher than the plant's bandwidth, and the aircraft is incapable of achieving the desired rates.  Unlike \ac{PID} control, the \Lone control never exhibited unstable performance with incorrect gains.  The controller simply oscillates with extremely poor performance.  This was a remarkable feature because poorly tuned \ac{PID} gains can cause an aircraft to depart controlled flight rapidly. Whereas, the \Lone controller maintained bounded flight performance as the theory suggests.  

\subsection{Tuning the Companion Model Cutoff Frequency}
System identification was conducted as seen in Appendix~\ref{appendix:system_identification} in order to ascertain the bandwidth of various airframes and their actuators.  Figure~\ref{fig:bode_analysis} is an example of second order models for two aircraft's roll dynamics compared to second order models of \ac{RC} actuators (servos).  As to be expected, the bandwidth for the actuators is slightly higher than the airframe dynamics.

These rough approximations were used to then place the cutoff frequencies of the companion model with the expectation that the companion model cannot achieve higher bandwidths than that of the airframe.  Conservatively, the companion model cutoff frequency was typically set 2-5 radians per second lower than the expected max performance of the airframe.  After the other algorithm gains are tuned, and satisfactory performance is achieved, the companion model cutoff frequency can then be increased to achieve higher performance.

\section{Improved Recursive Architecture}

The speed of adaptation and accuracy of the discretized \Lone algorithm is drastically improved with increased loop frequency.  The algorithm was written as one recursive architecture that updates at the Pixhawk's scheduled loop rate.  As previously discussed, the scheduled loop rate ideally should run at lower frequencies to prevent excessive log file size and added strain on the CPU.  However, the \Lone architecture only requires the adaptation loop be run at faster rates.  With this specific performance enhancement in mind, the \ac{APM} architecture could be modified to accept an independent loop specifically for the \Lone adaptation update.  The sensors measurements and \ac{EKF} update can run significantly lower with only increased performance of the algorithm.  The higher adaptation loop would enable higher adaptation gains $(\Gamma)$ and consequently produce faster adaptation of the system.
